# What is Express Connect? {#concept_ipg_pry_xdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Express Connect helps you build private network communication channels between VPCs or between a VPC and your on-premises data center. These channels feature increased network topology flexibility and enhanced cross-network communication quality and security. Express Connect also helps you mitigate unstable network latency and data breaches.

## Features {#section_v5t_z12_bfb .section}

Express Connect provides the following functions:

-   Express Cloud Connect

    Express Cloud Connect can meet the requirements regarding the underlying network links for guaranteed compliance within high-availability architecture. It is equipped with the SD-WAN technology provided by Smart Access Gateway \(SAG\) and can provide multiple value-added services, such as encrypted channels, direct access to Private Zone and other cloud resources, and accelerated Internet access.

-   Physical connection

    You can use a leased line from your service provider to establish a physical connection from your on-premises data center to an Alibaba Cloud access point. After the physical connection is established, you can create a Virtual Border Router \(VBR\) to connect your on-premises data center with Alibaba Cloud to build hybrid clouds.

    As a private network connection, the physical connection does not pass through the Internet. Compared with traditional Internet connections, the physical connection is safer, faster, more reliable, and has less latency.

-   VPC interconnection

    You can create a peering connection to build an intranet communication channel between two VPCs.


## Benefits {#section_s25_zw2_bfb .section}

The benefits of Express Connect are as follows:

-   High-speed intercommunication

    Powered by Alibaba Cloud, Express Connect can connect different network environments so that both ends can directly communicate with each other through an intranet connection without the need for access to the Internet. A low-latency, high-bandwidth intranet connection can be achieved regardless of the distance between the connected network environments.

-   Stability and reliability

    Built on the state-of-the-art infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud, Express Connect ensures stable and reliable communication between networks.

-   Security

    Express Connect implements cross-network communication at the network virtualization layer, where all data is transmitted through the infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud and tenants are isolated from each other.

-   Pay-As-You-Go billing

    Express Connect provides different bandwidth specifications. You only pay for resources used.
