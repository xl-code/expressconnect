# Scenarios {#concept_gkk_vwq_ydb .concept}

You can use Express Connect to create a secure and high-speed private network communication channel between two VPCs or between a VPC and an on-premises data center.

## Connect an on-premises data center to a VPC through a physical connection {#section_jr3_ywq_ydb .section}

If your on-premises data center needs to communicate with a VPC in Alibaba Cloud through a private network, you can apply for a physical connection or use the Express Cloud Connect \(ECC\) service provided by Alibaba Cloud. With a physical connection, you can establish a private network communication channel that is of high quality, highly reliable, and highly secure between your on-premises data center and the VPC.
