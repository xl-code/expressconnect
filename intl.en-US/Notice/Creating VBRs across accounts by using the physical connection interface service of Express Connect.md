# Creating VBRs across accounts by using the physical connection interface service of Express Connect {#concept_1236886 .concept}

Dear Alibaba Cloud customer:

On August 1, 2019, an update to the rules for using the **physical connection interface service of Express Connect** to create VBRs across accounts will take effect. By default, you can use each purchased physical connection interface instance under an account to create a maximum of five VBRs under the account. The number of the created VBRs can be adjusted based on service requirements.

You can use physical connection interface instances under an account to create a total of two VBRs under other accounts.

Thank you for your continued support!
