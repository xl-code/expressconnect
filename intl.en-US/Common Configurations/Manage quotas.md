# Manage quotas {#task_sf4_4x3_4gb .task}

You can query the number of remaining resources in your quota through the Express Connect console. If the remaining quota number is insufficient for your requirements, you can open a ticket to apply for an increase to your quota.

1.  Log on to the [Express Connect](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ri) console. 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quota Management**.
3.  View the resource usage of the Express Connect service under your account.
4.  To increase your resource quota, click **Apply** in the **Actions** column. Then, enter the following information: 

    -   **Quantity for Application**: the number of resources you require. You must enter a number that is greater than the current quota. For more information about the resource limits of Express Connect, see [Limits](../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#).
    -   **Reason for Application**: your reason for applying for an increase to your quota. We recommend that you include details about your specific scenario.
    -   **Mobile/Landline Phone Number**: the mobile or landline phone number of the person to contact.
    -   **Email**: the email address of the person to contact.
5.  Click **OK**. The system then determines whether the quota application is reasonable. If the system determines the request is unreasonable, the application enters the **Rejected** state. If the request is reasonable, the application enters the **Approved** state and the quota is automatically upgraded to the specified quota number.

    To view a history of quota applications, click **Application History** in the **Application History** column.
