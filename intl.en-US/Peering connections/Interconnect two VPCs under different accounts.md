# Interconnect two VPCs under different accounts {#concept_wrx_vbr_ydb .concept}

This topic describes how to use Express Connect to connect two VPCs under different accounts.

**Note:** 

-   If this is the first time you are using Express Connect to interconnect two VPCs, we recommend that you use CEN. For more information, see [Tutorial overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Quick Start/Tutorial overview.md#).

## Example {#section_ock_bcr_ydb .section}

In cross-account VPC interconnections, you need to create an initiator and an acceptor separately, establish a peering connection, and then configure routes. This topic uses the following two VPCs as an example. VPC1 under account A acts as the initiator and VPC2 under account B acts as the acceptor.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/13829/156579385813085_en-US.png)

5.  On the Add Instance page, select **Another Account** and enter the initiator router interface. In this example, enter ri-m5e33r3n78zyi5573kf85. Click **OK**.

## Step 4: Add the acceptor and establish a peering connection {#section_b4x_zgr_ydb .section}

After you add the initiator and the acceptor, the initiator can actively initiate and establish a peering connection between the two VPCs.

In this example, the connection initiator is VPC1 under account A. To establish a peering connection, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Express Connect console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ri) by using the credentials of account A.
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **VPC Peering Connections** \> **VPC-to-VPC**.
3.  Select the region of the initiator instance.

    In this example, select **China \(Qingdao\)**.

4.  Click **Add Acceptor**.

## Step 5: Configure routes {#section_tdw_xbr_ydb .section}

After establishing a peering connection, you need to add a route for each of the two VPCs.

To configure the routes, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [Express Connect console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ri) by using the credentials of account A.
2.  On the VPC Peering Connections page, find the created peering connection.
3.  Find the initiator instance and click **Route Settings**.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/13829/156579385913123_en-US.png)

4.  Click **Add Route**, enter the CIDR block of the VPC or VSwitch to be connected, and click **Confirm**.

    In this example, enter the CIDR block of the peer VPC: 172.16.0.0/16.

5.  Log on to the [Express Connect console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ri) by using the credentials of account B.
6.  Find the acceptor instance and click **Route Settings**.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/13829/156579385911721_en-US.png)

7.  Click **Add Route**, enter the destination CIDR block, and then click **Confirm**.

    In this example, enter the CIDR block of the peer VPC: 192.168.0.0/16.


## Step 6: Configure security groups {#section_zx1_ndf_hfb .section}

After establishing a peering connection between two VPCs, you need to configure security groups to enable the intercommunication of ECS instances in these two VPCs.

This topic uses the ECS instances and security groups in the following table as an example.

|Configuration|Account A|Account B|
|:------------|:--------|:--------|
|Account ID|AccountID\_A|AccountID\_B|
|ECS instance ID|InstanceID\_A|InstanceID\_B|
|Security group ID|SecurityGroupID\_A|SecurityGroupID\_B|

You can view the account ID in the [Account Center](https://account.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520001.aliyun_topbar.39.4cb94bd3LoJmJ3#/secure).

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/13830/156579386013186_en-US.png)

To configure the security group rule, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ecs).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Networks and Security** \> **Security Groups**.
3.  Select the region of the instance.
4.  Find the target security group and then click **Add Rules**.
5.  On the Security Group Rules page, click **Add Security Group Rule**.
6.  Configure the security group rule, select the protocol type, and enter the port range. Then select the authorization type according to the following information.

    |Scenario|Authorization type|Description|
    |:-------|:-----------------|:----------|
    |Cross-region VPC interconnection|CIDR block|The CIDR block of the peer VPC.|
    |Same-region VPC interconnection|Security group|The ID of the security group associated with the peer ECS instance. **Note:** If the VPCs to be interconnected belong to different accounts, select Allow Other Accounts and in the Account ID field, enter the peer account ID.

 |

    **Note:** 

    -   If the VPCs to be interconnected are in different regions, select the CIDR block authorization type and enter the CIDR block of the peer VPC. In this example, select the CIDR block authorization type.
    -   If the VPCs to be interconnected belong to the same region, select the security group authorization type. In cross-account interconnection, select **Allow Other Accounts** and in the Account ID field, enter the peer account ID.

## Step 7: Test the connection {#section_hj4_55m_cfb .section}

After establishing the peering connection and adding routes, you can log on to an ECS instance of either VPC and ping the IP address of an ECS instance in the other VPC. If the ping succeeds, the connection between the two VPCs is successful.
